# pewlett_hackard_analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to identify how many employees will be retiring from pewlett_hackard soon vs how many will be remaining. The goal is to understand the difference between the two in order to staff appropriately for the future. In order to do this we need to determine the number of retiring employees and identify employees that are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. Using SQL will help us understand where Pewlett Hackard is at and what is needed to be done to avoid the "Silver Tsunami". 

We will deliver this data starting with the below ERD to get a better understanding of the data relationships in regards to primary and foreign keys.

# Major Points of contention
+ We are seeing that there is a large number of employees retiring which will create a giant gap in team members needed. As you can see below, there are over 72K people retiring. 
+ One main factor is that the majority of team members retiring are of senior level as seen in the table below.

+ There is a very low amount of employees eligible for the mentorship program. Majority of them do seem to trend more towards senior titles. See table below. 
+ Pewlett Hackard needs to start recruiting immediately and add to the mentorship program if they want to survive the "Silver Tsunami". 
+ We need more data to truly determine if there are more employees outside of our current data scope that we can push into the mentorship program early. This will fast track them to success and in turn will identify more talent.

# Summary

This analysis proves that Pewlett Hackard needs to act quickly to maintain enough employees to keep them afloat. I would also like to see data for individuals with birthdates after 1965 to see what other ways we can slow this tsunami down...it might just be inevitable and will take some time to recover. There may be a need for dual roles etc.
